Fotball Tournament Application is an app made to help you manage a fotball tournament with ease. The app lets you register teams and 
individual players as well as automatically generating match ups between the entered teams. Statitics for each game and individual
players can be added with ease, and game statistics, history and tournament results are generated by the app.
