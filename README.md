Fotball Tournament Application is an app made to help you manage a fotball tournament with ease. The app lets you register teams and 
individual players as well as automatically generating match ups between the entered teams. Statitics for each game and individual
players can be added with ease, and game statistics, history and tournament results are generated by the app.

Description of issue board "Development"

Work-process description, concerning coding of classes:

1.	Issue is created with description of contents expected to be included in each class. The issue is put in the “Open” board. 
a.	The issue is written on the form “Code 'class name' with unit tests”.
2.	A group member creates a class with JavaDoc and unit tests in a distinct test class. The issue is moved to the “In progress” board.
3.	When the first draft of the class is done, the issue is further moved to the “Testing” board, and the issue is assigned to another member of the group for quality assurance. 
4.	Then the issue is moved back to “In progress” and assigned to the person that first created the class. 
5.	Then the issue is moved to “Testing” again, for double assurance of the quality. The same group member which originally tested is once again assigned to the issue. 
a.	If the class is approved, it is moved to the board “Done”.
b.	Otherwise the process described over is repeated.
